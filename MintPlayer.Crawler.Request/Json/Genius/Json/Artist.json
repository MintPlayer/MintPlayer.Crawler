Love music and do quite a bit of it on my own, and I love going to concerts as well <3\n\nMy Instagram is @love_queenbreebree and it’s mainly playlist based and filled with some of my favorite songs, artists, and music in general! Check it out if you want to ;)\n\nMake sure to check out Van Alden, they are an amazing Pop-Noir band and they sound so amazing. Seriously one of my favorite bands right now :)\n\nExcited to be on Genius, helping out new/little known artists makes me feel happy. Always open to transcribing and researching to make more lyrics available to the Genius community :)",
